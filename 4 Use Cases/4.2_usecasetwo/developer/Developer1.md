# Second Part One complete Integration Absence

## 🧑‍💻 **Qualitative Metrics (Expert Review)**

Three developers will evaluate the generated artifacts using a standardized questionnaire based on a Likert scale (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent).

## **📝 Evaluation Form for Experts**

**Instructions:** Please evaluate the following artifacts that were generated by an AI system for automated API integration.

## **Part 1: Code Quality Evaluation (Generated Kotlin Code)**

| Criterion | Rating (1-5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1.1 Readability & Structure:** The code is clear, logical, and understandable. | 5 | The code is self-explanatory, with clear variable names that aid understanding. |
| **1.2 Maintainability:** The code is modular and well-commented. | 5 | The code follows the single responsibility principle, with comments used only for structure or to clarify non-obvious decisions. |
| **1.3 Naming Conventions:** Variables, functions, etc. are meaningfully named. | 5 |  |
| **1.4 Error Handling:** The code contains robust error handling. | 4 | The error handling covers nullable variables, but potential exceptions aren’t addressed. In production, we’ll likely encounter edge cases that require exception handling. |

## **Part 2: Explainability & Documentation Evaluation**

| Criterion | Rating (1-5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2.1 Clarity of Mapping Rationales:** The reasons for mappings are logical and comprehensible. | 3 | Some mapping decisions are not clear from the code itself, e.g. 
- “`// ✅ MAP TYPE FROM EMPLOYEE NOTE`" (why?), or 
- “`// ✅ BUILD PASSTHROUGH DATA WITH ALL FIELDS`" (why use passthrough?)

With the help of the markdown files, we can get an idea what the AI was trying to achieve but some decisions are not entirely clear. |
| **2.2 Quality of Code Comments:** The comments are helpful and precise. | 5 | The comments are balanced. Not too many, not too few. |
| **2.3 Completeness of Process Documentation:** The planning files and reports.md files (e.g., `PLANNING.md`) provide a complete overview. | 4 | The process documentation is useful for understanding specific mapping decisions, but it’s too long to read fully. As noted in 2.1, some decisions remain unclear, though the documentation can help form hypotheses about why the AI failed on certain mappings. |
| **2.4 Traceability of Overall Process:** The process from specification to code is comprehensible. | 4 | The process documentation is very detailed, and likely too much for a regular developer to read through. Its main value, in my view, is for debugging the process from the perspective of the AI process developer. |

## **Part 3: Overall Impression and Trust**

Description: (Just replace mark the field with an X where you think it is)

| Statement | Strongly Disagree (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | Strongly Agree (5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1 Trust:** I would trust the generated code (after a review) in a production system. |  |  |  | x |  | The code lines that are not hallucinated look solid; the reviewer would have to catch hallucinations though. |
| **3.2 Added Value:** The system provides significant added value compared to manual implementation. |  |  | x |  |  | I don’t expect a big time advantage over manual work yet. For it to matter, we need fewer manual fixes and hallucinations, and a broader scope, like handling authentication with the third-party system, or Facade classes that handle the actual interaction with the third-party system. |
| **3.3 Separation:** Controller/Service/Mapper are properly separated. |  |  |  |  | x |  |

## **Final Remarks:**

Overall, a good starting point for iteratively relaxing assumptions and constraints, making the approach increasingly applicable to real-world use cases.
