# Second Part One complete Integration Absence

## 🧑‍💻 **Qualitative Metrics (Expert Review)**

Three developers will evaluate the generated artifacts using a standardized questionnaire based on a Likert scale (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent).

## **📝 Evaluation Form for Experts**

**Instructions:** Please evaluate the following artifacts that were generated by an AI system for automated API integration.

## **Part 1: Code Quality Evaluation (Generated Kotlin Code)**

| Criterion | Rating (1-5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1.1 Readability & Structure:** The code is clear, logical, and understandable. | 4 | clear structure and understandable |
| **1.2 Maintainability:** The code is modular and well-commented. | 3 | some important comments are there, but not in detail |
| **1.3 Naming Conventions:** Variables, functions, etc. are meaningfully named. | 5 | Naming is done right, no problems there  |
| **1.4 Error Handling:** The code contains robust error handling. | 4 | It uses try cartch blocks, but often goes the shortcut instead of real implementation |

## **Part 2: Explainability & Documentation Evaluation**

| Criterion | Rating (1-5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2.1 Clarity of Mapping Rationales:** The reasons for mappings are logical and comprehensible. | 4 | Mappings are good, only 1 parameter is not really mapped, start enddate halfday, type is good mapped, only thing is status which is not working with mapping |
| **2.2 Quality of Code Comments:** The comments are helpful and precise. | 3 | less comments, more comments would improve it |
| **2.3 Completeness of Process Documentation:** The planning files and reports.md files (e.g., `PLANNING.md`) provide a complete overview. | 4 | Good overview and understanding of what was done throught he files, a little too much , maybe more precise would be better |
| **2.4 Traceability of Overall Process:** The process from specification to code is comprehensible. | 5 | from the files it is clear what happens when |

## **Part 3: Overall Impression and Trust**

Description: (Just replace mark the field with an X where you think it is)

| Statement | Strongly Disagree (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | Strongly Agree (5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1 Trust:** I would trust the generated code (after a review) in a production system. |  |  | X |  |  | The foundation structure is good, and it also does not write too much code, but sometimes it still takes shortcuts, they need to be eliminated and the model need to ask back if it does not understand something |
| **3.2 Added Value:** The system provides significant added value compared to manual implementation. |  |  |  | X |  | The system helps me get faster into the solution I am developing and helps me with clear understanding of the problem and what to match. I just need to validate the endpoints and maybe change one or two, in generall it worked quite good, but there is still room for improvement |
| **3.3 Separation:** Controller/Service/Mapper are properly separated. |  |  | X |  |  | Controller seperation is a 5/5 also the mapper is good seperated but the service has its key parts, but mapper parts are still in service and I dont know why  |

## **Final Remarks:**

*(Space for open feedback, improvement suggestions, or special observations)*

All in all the Mapping and code genration is on a good way, it is not the one click solution from the beginning, but a valid standing point from the Start. This is good and helps developers, further improvements in the Architecture may help to increase this.
